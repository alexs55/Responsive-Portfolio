                    <p class="text1">My name is Alexander but I usually go by Alex. I started to learn how to code in order to be more deeply integrated with today's technology. There is this connection between technology and bringing humanity forward that makes me want to develop or build the next generation of devices.</p>
                    <p class="text1">In my free time i usually scout the internet for new developments that could be upcoming. You could usually find me geeking out videogames and that is because to some extent I see them as a form of art and communication. As I develop my skills, this page will be updated to exhibit newfound ideas.</p>
